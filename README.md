The main responsibility of the inventory management system is to be able to track the inventory levels of various items that your business needs in stock. You must keep track of the quantity of each item in stock, as well its price.

## Planning
We worked the entirery of the backend as a team. After our backend was up and running, we started wit the user authentication on the frontend side of the application. After we were done with both assignments, we started working on CRUD separately to be merged in the development branch together. Once all of our CRUD items were done, we started to work on special functionalities, like limiting max currency and quantity, adding decimals and working on building a user friendly inventory management so any of the employees could make updates to the table that would be tracked back to that user. We worked developing a rich layout that would make the website even better than before.
